## Sample Input and Output

This repository includes sample input and output files to demonstrate the behavior of the code. Here's how to use them:

- `samples_IO/input.txt`: This file contains sample input data that you can use to test the code.
- `samples_IO/output.txt`: Corresponding to the input, this file contains the expected output produced by the code.

### How to Use

You can test the code by providing `input.txt` as input and comparing the generated output with `output.txt`. These samples are intended to help you understand the code's behavior and verify correctness.
